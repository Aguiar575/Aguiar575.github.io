## 1 - Bright Recipe AeroPress

### Ingredients:
- 10g ground coffee
- 150g hot water

### Instructions:
1. **Insert a paper filter** in the cap and attach it to the brew chamber. Place over a cup and rinse with hot water. Discard the rinse water.
   
2. **Add 10g of ground coffee** to the brew chamber.

3. **Add 100g of hot water**. Pour into the side of the brew chamber while simultaneously spinning the AeroPress to ensure the grounds are fully saturated.

4. **Stir 3 times**.

5. **Insert the plunger** at the top of the brew chamber and lift up slightly to create a seal. Let steep for 1:00 to 1:30 minutes.

6. **Top up the brew with 50g of hot water**.

### Optional:
- For less acidity, you can use the **inverted AeroPress method**
### Notes:
- The total brew time should be between 1:30 to 2:00 minutes.
- This recipe is designed to produce a bright, clear coffee with a fuller body for a more robust mouthfeel.

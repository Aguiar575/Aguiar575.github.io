# Write-Ahead Logging

Or WAL, this is a technique to achieve consistency and durability in distributed systems. 
Also, you see this every day, every single database use this, to keep tracking of the changes. 

## How it works

The simplest examples focus on a databaseâ€”a basic one, without sharding. Before making any changes to the data on the disk, 
you write the changes to a log file. If the database crashes in the middle of a transaction, 
it can recover the actions by referring to the log file.

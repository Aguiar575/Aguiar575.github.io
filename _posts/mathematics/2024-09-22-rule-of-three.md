This is a mathematical model used to solve proportion problems, 
the problems can involve direct or indirect proportional quantities. it can be simple or compound. 

## Simple Rule of Three

Simple rule of three involves only two direct or indirect proportional quantities. 

- if 2 products cost $10, how much 5 products will cost?
    - $$2/10 = 5/x ⇒ 2x = 10.5 ⇒ 2x = 50 ⇒ x = 25$$

## Compound Rule of Three

Involves more than two quantities, could be direct or indirect proportional quantities.

- If 6 workers build a wall in 10 days working 8 hours per day,
how many workers are needed to build the same wall in 5 days, working 6 hours per day?
    - Identify the quantities:
        - Workers (W)
        - Days (D)
        - Hours per day (H)
    - Set up the table:

| **Workers (W)** | **Days (D)** | **Hours per Day (H)** |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:---------------------:|
| 6               | 10           | 8                     |
| x               | 5            | 6                     |

- The relationships:
    - **Days and Workers**: Fewer days require more workers (inverse proportion).
    - **Hours and Workers**: Fewer hours per day require more workers (inverse proportion).
- $$6.10.8 = x.5.6 ⇒ 6.10.8 = x.30 ⇒ 480 = x.30 ⇒ x = 16$$
